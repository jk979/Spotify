## Introduction

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Summary
<<<<<<< HEAD

Content recommendation is one of the most active areas of contemporary data science research. Techniques broadly fall within two categories (with some hybrid approaches that combine the two): collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. Generally, collaborative filtering utilizes data on existing usersâ€™ preferences to identify similar users or content, and then makes recommendations based on the similar content or on the content selected by similar users. Content-based recommendation, on the other hand, relies on the underlying features of the content, taking a hedonic approach to identifying content that a given user may enjoy.
